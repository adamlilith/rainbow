# rainbow

This R package is for extracting daily, monthly, and annual climate data from the proprietary version of the Parameter Regression on Independent Slopes ([PRISM](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/)) raster data set for the coterminous United States (Daly et al. 2002). Users must have a licensed copy of the PRISM data set.

The one-and-only function in the package is named `extractRainbow` and requires pointers to the base folder with PRISM data, the name(s) of the variables(s) to be extracted, and a data frame with coordinates and dates. Users can extract data for the day/month/year of each record plus values for a user-defined temporal window preceding the day/month/year of extraction. For example, you could use `extractRainbow` to get all daily minimum temperature (`tmin`) values for a location for April 24th, 2014 and every day of 280 days before that. Or, for example, you could get the mean monthly value of minimum temperature for April of 2014 and the 18 months before that. Or, the annual values for 2014 and the 10 years prior to that.

The `rainbow` package uses functions from the `lubridate` for handling dates, `terra` for handling rasters, and either `sp` or `sf` for handling spatial point data.

If you have RTools installed on your computer, you can install this package in R using this command:

`remotes::install_github('adamlilith/enmSdm', dependencies=TRUE)`  

If for some reason this does not work, you can install the package by downloading the latest zip/tar file from the `zipTarFiles` directory and installing it manually.
